Unmodified Postgres 17 Docker image with all extensions and migrations.

#### Notes

- Includes [pg_cron][pg_cron] `postgres` extension.

#### Dependencies

- Depends on [diesel][diesel] as an objectâ€“relational mapping and
  [diesel_migrations][diesel_migrations] as a migration tool.
- Depends on community crates [diesel_async][diesel_async] for asynchronous
  connections and [diesel_derive_enum][diesel_derive_enum] for enum boilerplate.

#### Guidelines

- Migrations are append-only. Once a migration is merged into the `main` branch,
  do not modify it.
- Migrations in `migration/` must be idempotent, ensuring they can be run
  multiple times without causing issues.
- Self-hosted service users should update role passwords separately after
  running all migrations.
- Production releases are done by publishing a new GitHub release from the
  `main` branch.
