Unmodified Postgres 17 Docker image with all extensions and migrations.

#### Notes

- Includes [pg_cron][pg_cron] `postgres` extension.
- Consists out of [axiston_db_migrate][migrate] and [axiston_db_schema][schema]
  crates.

[migrate]: https://crates.io/crates/axiston-db-migrate
[schema]: https://crates.io/crates/axiston-db-schema

#### Dependencies

- Depends on [diesel][diesel] as an objectâ€“relational mapping and
  [diesel_migrations][diesel_migrations] as a migration tool.
- Depends on [diesel_async][diesel_async] for asynchronous connections and
  [diesel_derive_enum][diesel_derive_enum] for enum boilerplate.

#### Guidelines

- Migrations are append-only. Once a migration is merged into the `main` branch,
  do not modify it.
- Migrations in `migration/` must be idempotent, ensuring they can be run
  multiple times without causing issues.
- Self-hosted service users should update role passwords separately after
  running all migrations.
- Production releases are done by publishing a new GitHub release from the
  `main` branch.
